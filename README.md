# Mathmataz
Mathmataz is a mental math game in the form of a single-page web application that runs entirely in the browser. Once loaded,
it can be played off-line until the user closes the browser window. The app has two games, one involving addition and subtraction
and another involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I'm not going to describe the game further since
you can visit www.mathmataz.com and see it in action. The app is based on a verbal math game that my wife and I would play with our 
children in the car on long drives, and I must give a 'shout out' to my father-in-law who introduced the game to us.

I learned a heck of a lot about Javascript in building this application. When I was finished, I had the inclination to rebuild it
from scratch with my new knowledge, but I didn't think that would be a prudent use of my time. It works really well, as a simple
math app should, and I've played it enough times that don't believe it has any bugs. If I were to rework the app, I would start 
with the doMath function that creates the unique math problems, and I would write it in a more functional programming style. I've
created this repository as part of my portfolio as a beginning programmer, but I would love to read any comments or suggestions
regarding the code.
